    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Step 1 - each of the character positions of the target user agent are checked
    /// from right to left to determine if a complete node or sub string is present
    /// at that position. For example; the sub string Chrome/11 might indicate the 
    /// user agent relates to Chrome version 11 from Google. Once every character
    /// position is checked a list of matching nodes will be available.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Step 2 - The list of signatures is then searched to determine if the matching 
    /// nodes relate exactly to an existing signature. Any popular device will be found
    /// at this point. The approach is exceptionally fast at identifying popular
    /// devices. This is termed the Exact match method.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Step 3 - If a match has not been found exactly then the target user agent is
    /// evaluated to find nodes that have the smallest numeric difference. For example
    /// if Chrome/40 were in the target user agent at the same position as Chrome/32 
    /// in the signature then Chrome/32 with a numeric difference score of 8 would be
    /// used. If a signature can then be matched exactly against the new set of nodes
    /// this will be returned. This is termed the Numeric match method.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Step 4 - If the target user agent is less popular, or newer than the creation time
    /// of the data set, a small sub set of possible signatures are identified from the
    /// matchied nodes. The sub set is limited to the most popular 200 signatures.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Step 5 - The sub strings of the signatures from Step 4 are then evaluated to determine
    /// if they exist in the target user agent. For example if Chrome/32 in the target 
    /// appears one character to the left of Chrome/32 in the signature then a difference
    /// of 1 would be returned between the signature and the target. This is termed the
    /// Nearest match method.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Step 6 - The signatures from Step 4 are evaluated against the target user agent to 
    /// determine the difference in relevent characters between them. The signature with the 
    /// lowest difference in ASCII character values with the target is returned. This is termed
    /// the Closest match method.
    /// </para>
